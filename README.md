# Multi-modal Physiological Emotion Recognition Using Contrastive Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing emotions using multimodal physiological signals using contrastive learning. It leverages various deep learning models to process and analyze data for emotion detection.

## Features
- **Multimodal Data Processing**: Handles multiple physiological signals.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Implements contrastive learning techniques for improved model performance.
- **Customizable Models**: Various model architectures and layers for experimentation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xingbowei1/Multi-modal-Physiological-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Contrastive-Learning.git
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset.
2. Configure your model and training parameters in `main.py`.
3. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
